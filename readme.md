Now that I've worked with React and have multiple projects to share, I am updating my portfolio and other materials. This project takes the personal profile that I have previously created and renders it using react.  Additional funcitonality has been added due to the ease of using react.  

* The project has met all the requirements outlined in the assignment.

- A `Header` (Navbar) component that appears on multiple pages

- A single `Project` component that will be used multiple times on a single page
